Hi there. My name is Ken Cheng (Official name Yongkang Cheng)

I'm currently a first-year student in University of Toronto. I'm interested in programming and electrical devices. I started to learn Python since I was in grade 10. So far, I have made few little projects and I'm looking forward to make further changes.

Currently, I know a little bit of Java and C. I'm learning C in this winter break.

Keep going, Ken!
