Hi there. My name is <b>Ken Cheng</b> (Official name <b>Yongkang Cheng</b>)

I'm currently an 2nd year student majored in Computer Engineering at University of Toronto who is enthused in practical-oriented electrical devices and computer programming. I started to learn Python when I was in grade 10. So far, I have made a few little projects and I'm looking forward to making further changes.

To evaluate myself, I’m an idea generator, fast learner, very logical and objective, with a mild temper and a perfectionist streak. Here’s my [resume](https://chengyongkang.me/resume.pdf).

Currently, I know a little bit of Java and C. I'm learning C in this winter break.

Keep going, Ken!

Today is the first day of winter term! Through this winter break, I’ve updated several projects in my repositories. This term will be very busy because I want to apply for an internship for this summer vacation. I’m striving to be a full stack engineer, but I know it requires a lot of skills. While learning academic courses, I would like to develop some new projects using Javascript, C, Java, or some other languages to help me integrate all these skills together.

During the summer, I learned APS360 - Applied Fundamentals of Deep Learning, and made a fantastic project of Handwritten English Recognition with a group of 4. I also learned React Native and React JS. Never cease learning!

I think I'm ready to apply a job - although not fully prepared. Nothing's perfect, right?
