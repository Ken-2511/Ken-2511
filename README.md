Hi there. My name is <b>Ken Cheng</b> (Official name <b>Yongkang Cheng</b>)

I'm currently an undergrad first-year student at University of Toronto who is enthused in practical-oriented electrical devices and computer programming. I started to learn Python when I was in grade 10. So far, I have made a few little projects and I'm looking forward to making further changes.

To evaluate myself, I’m an idea generator, fast learner, very logical and objective, with a mild temper and a perfectionist streak. Here’s my resume: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JLkEsV-870l9Ov8YlNbPtf3-qjXwi8XxzYBxNVzgdH4

Currently, I know a little bit of Java and C. I'm learning C in this winter break.

Keep going, Ken!

Today is the first day of winter term! Through this winter break, I’ve updated several projects in my repositories. This term will be very busy because I want to apply for an internship for this summer vacation. I’m striving to be a full stack engineer, but I know it requires a lot of skills. While learning academic courses, I would like to develop some new projects using Javascript, C, Java, or some other languages to help me integrate all these skills together.
